# Learning from USB-C to USB-A Adapter Project

This project is my first PCB design, created as a warm-up and learning experience for Hack Club Highway 2026.

## What you can learn here

- **Basic PCB design workflow:**  
  From schematic capture to PCB layout, using free/open tools (like KiCAD).

- **Simple USB adapter design:**  
  How to design a USB-C to USB-A adapter board with 2 layers and appropriate dimensions.

- **3D visualization:**  
  How to generate and include 3D views of your PCB to better understand component placement.

- **Open source licensing:**  
  How to apply GPLv3 license to your hardware project.

## How to get started

1. Explore the schematic and PCB files in the repository.
2. Open the 3D view models to get a visual understanding of the design.
3. Check the README images to see how the final product looks.
4. Use this as a base for your own hardware projects or for learning PCB design.

## Resources used

- KiCAD (schematic & PCB design)
- GNU GPLv3 license
- Basic electronics knowledge about USB connectors and signals
